            <h1>The Montreal Protocol: How the World Healed Its Sky</h1>
            <p>When scientists in the 1970s first sounded the alarm that humanity was eroding the <strong>stratospheric ozone layer</strong>, their warning cut through political boundaries and industrial interests. The ozone layer—our planet’s thin, ultraviolet-absorbing shield—was being chemically destroyed by human-made <strong>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</strong> and <strong>halons</strong> used in aerosols, refrigerators, and air conditioners.</p>
            <p>By the early 1980s, satellite data and field measurements over Antarctica revealed an alarming <em>ozone hole</em>, confirming the worst fears of atmospheric chemists. In one of the most remarkable acts of global cooperation, the world’s nations responded not with denial, but with action.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>A Timeline of Discovery and Response</h2>
            <p><strong>1974 — The Chemistry of Destruction</strong><br />
            Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland published their seminal paper explaining how CFCs rise into the stratosphere, where UV radiation breaks them apart, releasing chlorine atoms that catalyze ozone destruction. A single chlorine atom could destroy tens of thousands of ozone molecules before being deactivated.</p>
            <p><strong>1985 — The Antarctic Ozone Hole</strong><br />
            British Antarctic Survey scientists reported a dramatic seasonal depletion of ozone over Antarctica. The discovery shocked policymakers and accelerated diplomatic talks already underway.</p>
            <p><strong>1987 — The Montreal Protocol Signed</strong><br />
            Negotiated under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the <strong>Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer</strong> was adopted in September 1987. It required industrialized nations to phase out key ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and provided financial and technical assistance to developing countries to follow suit.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>How the Montreal Protocol Works</h2>
            <p>The Protocol is both <strong>simple and flexible</strong>, two qualities that explain its enduring success.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Science-based targets:</strong> ODSs are listed in annexes, and control measures are updated as new evidence emerges.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal participation:</strong> All 198 UN member states are parties—making it the first treaty in history to achieve universal ratification.</li>
            <li><strong>Differentiated responsibility:</strong> Wealthier nations phase out ODSs first and support developing nations via the <strong>Multilateral Fund</strong>, which finances technology transitions.</li>
            <li><strong>Built-in revision mechanism:</strong> Periodic meetings (the <em>Meetings of the Parties</em>) allow for adjustments based on the latest science.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <h2>The Results: A Healing Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Since 1989, production of the most harmful CFCs and halons has dropped by over <strong>99%</strong>. Atmospheric concentrations of chlorine and bromine have begun to decline, and the ozone layer shows measurable signs of recovery.<br />
            Models predict that—if compliance continues—the Antarctic ozone hole will close by <strong>around 2060</strong>.</p>
            <p>The Montreal Protocol has also delivered a <strong>climate dividend</strong>: many ODSs are potent greenhouse gases. By preventing their release, the treaty has avoided the equivalent of <strong>hundreds of billions of tonnes of CO₂ emissions</strong>, making it one of the most effective climate policies ever enacted.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>The Kigali Amendment: Expanding the Legacy</h2>
            <p>In 2016, nations adopted the <strong>Kigali Amendment</strong>, targeting <strong>hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</strong>—chemicals developed to replace CFCs but later found to be powerful greenhouse gases.<br />
            While HFCs do not destroy ozone, their phase-down under the same legal framework reinforces the Protocol’s status as a living, evolving treaty.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Lessons for Today’s Climate Challenge</h2>
            <p>The Montreal Protocol is more than a treaty—it’s a case study in what global environmental governance can achieve when:</p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Science is trusted and acted upon.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Costs are shared fairly between nations.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Policies include mechanisms for learning and revision.</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>In a world now wrestling with the scale and urgency of climate change, the Montreal Protocol stands as proof that multilateral action can not only <em>halt</em> environmental harm but <em>reverse</em> it.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Enacted:</strong> 1987  <strong>Entered into force:</strong> 1989</li>
            <li><strong>Parties:</strong> 198 (universal)</li>
            <li><strong>ODS reduction:</strong> &gt;99%</li>
            <li><strong>Estimated ozone recovery:</strong> mid-21st century</li>
            <li><strong>Climate co-benefit:</strong> Avoided warming ≈ 0.5 °C by 2050</li>
            </ul>
